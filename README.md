# News-Data-Analysis-with-Event-Driven-Incremental-Load-in-Snowflake
This project focuses on building a news data analytics pipeline with an event-driven incremental load strategy into a Snowflake table. It showcases how to extract data from an API endpoint, store raw files in Google Cloud Storage (GCS), and then incrementally load and process that data in Snowflake using Airflow orchestration.
